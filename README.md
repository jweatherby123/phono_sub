# phono_sub
A central way to submit phonon calculations.

## Supported codes

1) DFTB+

## Codes in progress

1) Quantum ESPRESSO
2) CRYSTAL17

## Setting environment variables
In the file `env.py`, you will need to set the path for various code-dependant variables.
One example is the Slater-Koster files required by `DFTB+`.
